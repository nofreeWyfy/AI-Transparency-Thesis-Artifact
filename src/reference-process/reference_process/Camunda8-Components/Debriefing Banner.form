Your participation contributes to research on human-AI collaboration and decision-making in business contexts.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3 style=\"margin-top: 20px; color: #1a355b;\">Debriefing</h3>\n  <p>\n    The purpose of this experiment was to investigate how <strong>transparency</strong> and <strong>explainability</strong> in AI systems influence <strong>trust</strong> and the willingness to <strong>delegate decisions</strong>. \n    For this reason, you encountered three different conditions during the study:\n  </p>\n\n  <div style=\"background-color: #f5f7fa; padding: 12px; border-left: 4px solid #7f8f9a; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 12px;\">\n    <ul style=\"margin: 0 0 0 18px;\">\n      <p>- <strong>Human-made decision</strong>: a decision made solely by a human reviewer</p>\n      <p>- <strong>AI-supported decision with explanation</strong>: an LLM recommendation plus a short explanation (<em>“white-box”</em>)</p>\n      <p>- <strong>AI-automated decision without explanation</strong>: an automatically generated decision with no further transparency (<em>“black-box”</em>)</p>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n\n  <p>\n    By comparing these conditions, the study aims to understand how people perceive and evaluate outcomes when AI is involved in decision-making processes.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3 style=\"margin-top: 20px; color: #1a355b;\">Data & Privacy</h3>\n  <div style=\"background-color: #f5f7fa; padding: 12px; border-left: 4px solid #557a95; border-radius: 4px;\">\n    Again, <strong>No personal data</strong> was collected during this study.
